# ALBATROSS
Automated Li-ion BAttery Testing RObot SyStem (ALBATROSS)

ALBATROSS uses PLC (NX102-9000, Omron) for integration of devices. <br>
Main PC communicates with PLC by using OPC-UA communication protocol. <br>
Communication protocols for OT2 and potentiostat are not supported by PLC, so they are directly communicate with PC.
